# 🇩🇪 Public Sector Intelligence Briefing — Gemini (Grounded) + GitHub Actions

This repo sends you a **daily email** that matches the structure of your **Public Sector Intelligence Briefing** template:
- ⚡ Today’s Top Priority
- Target-account intelligence (FITKO, BVA, Saxony, Sachsen‑Anhalt, Thüringen, Niedersachsen — configurable)
- Regulatory countdown (e.g., EU AI Act dates — grounded & cited)
- Strategic themes
- Prioritized action items (P1/P2/P3 table)
- Key dates ahead
- Sources & methodology

It uses the **Gemini API** with **Google Search grounding** to generate **cited** insights, then emails the briefing via **Gmail SMTP**.

Reliability features in the current implementation:
- preflight model check before the full run
- automatic model fallback across a preferred + low-cost model list
- automatic retry with a reduced token budget when quota pressure is detected
- quota/rate-limit alert email fallback so runs do not fail silently

## 1) Add GitHub Actions secrets

In your repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio API key |
| `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | Your inbox (comma-separated OK) |
| `SMTP_USER` | Your Gmail address (sender) |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Gmail **App Password** (requires 2FA) |

---

## 2) Run it
- Manual: **Actions → “Send Public Sector Briefing” → Run workflow**
- Scheduled: daily cron in `.github/workflows/daily.yml`

Cron is UTC. Adjust if you want a fixed Berlin send time year-round.

## 3) Customize territory + accounts
Edit: `src/config.json`

- `prepared_for`: your name
- `territory`: list of regions / orgs
- `briefing_mode`: `compact` (default) for tight, signal-first daily updates, or `standard` when you want more narrative context
- `lookback_hours`: recency window used in prompt instructions (default `72`)
- `accounts`: target accounts with seed “active projects to watch”
- `themes`: your 3–5 strategic themes
- `regulatory_items`: optional list of key regs/dates to always track
- `email.subject_prefix`: subject prefix for both briefing and operational fallback emails

### Model + output control

Edit the `model` section in `src/config.json`:

- `preferred_models`: your preferred model IDs (retired 1.0/1.5 IDs are automatically ignored)
- `max_output_tokens`: generation token budget for the main pass
- `temperature`: model creativity level
- `brevity.target_words`: target range used in instructions
- `brevity.max_words`: hard target used in instructions for concise output
- `brevity.section_word_limits`: per-section word ceilings injected into the system instruction

If output still runs long, the script performs a compression pass that preserves section order and citations.

### Choosing a briefing mode

- `compact` (recommended for daily runs): Keeps the briefing short, allows 2 verified signals when fewer than 3 high-confidence developments exist, and limits subsection bullet density.
- `standard`: Better for stakeholder readouts where extra background is useful. It still remains evidence-based, but allows richer explanatory context.

## Notes on citations
The script requests grounded output and injects citations from Gemini’s `groundingMetadata`.
If the model returns no grounding metadata on a run, the email will include a note.

## Operational behavior (quota / billing)
If Gemini API quota or rate limits are exhausted, the workflow sends a short **quota alert email** instead of failing silently.

Operational sequence:
1. preflight check on the first configured model
2. generation with model fallback list
3. retry with reduced token budget if quota pressure appears
4. fallback alert email if generation remains blocked

What to check if this happens repeatedly:
- Enable billing for your Google AI Studio project.
- Increase Gemini API limits (RPM/TPM).
- Reduce `model.max_output_tokens` in `src/config.json`.
- Optionally tighten `model.brevity.target_words` and `model.brevity.section_word_limits`.

## Included reference
Your original DOCX template is included in `assets/` for reference.

## Scaling to “all public sector entities” in your states (recommended approach)

Trying to enumerate *every* entity name inside the LLM prompt is brittle and incomplete.
Instead, this template supports a **two-layer coverage model**:

### Layer A — Portal-first coverage (broad, entity-agnostic)
Each run prioritizes signals from sources that naturally cover **many public-sector entities at once**, e.g.:
- procurement / tender portals
- ministry & agency pressrooms
- budget / programme announcements

This gives you “whole-territory” coverage without maintaining a massive list.

### Layer B — Rotating entity spotlight (deep, specific)
A configurable number of entities are “spotlighted” each day (e.g., 25) so that over a week you cycle through the universe.
You can also set an “always-on” list (state CIO office, central IT provider, key ministries, etc.).

### Where to configure it
Edit `src/config.json`:
- `entity_coverage.mode`
- `entity_coverage.spotlight_entities_per_day`
- `entity_coverage.always_include`
- `entity_coverage.entity_universe_path`

And edit the universe itself:
- `src/entity_universe.json`

Tip: Start with top-level entities (state ministries, central IT providers, key agencies) and add subordinate bodies + major Kommunen over time.
