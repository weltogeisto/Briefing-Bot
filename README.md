# 🇩🇪 Public Sector Intelligence Briefing — Gemini (Grounded) + GitHub Actions

This repo sends you a **daily email** that matches the structure of your **Public Sector Intelligence Briefing** template:
- ⚡ Today’s Top Priority
- Target-account intelligence (FITKO, BVA, Saxony, Sachsen‑Anhalt, Thüringen, Niedersachsen — configurable)
- Regulatory countdown (e.g., EU AI Act dates — grounded & cited)
- Strategic themes
- Prioritized action items (P1/P2/P3 table)
- Key dates ahead
- Sources & methodology

It uses the **Gemini API** with **Google Search grounding** to generate **cited** insights, then emails the briefing via **Gmail SMTP**.

Reliability features in the current implementation:
- preflight model check to fail fast on API key / quota issues before spending the main token budget
- collector-first source discovery from configured public RSS/pages before Gemini writes the email
- single-model execution based on your configured `preferred_models` list
- source-only digest fallback when Gemini quota/rate limits are hit after source candidates were collected
- quota/rate-limit alert email fallback when generation is blocked and no source-only digest can be produced
- configurable throttling between Gemini requests (`GEMINI_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC`)
- GitHub Actions artifacts with candidate sources, rejected candidates, final markdown, and quality diagnostics
- monthly keepalive workflow (`keepalive.yml`) that prevents GitHub from auto-disabling the schedule after 60 days of repo inactivity

## 1) Add GitHub Actions secrets

In your repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio API key |
| `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | Your inbox (comma-separated OK) |
| `SMTP_USER` | Your Gmail address (sender) |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Gmail **App Password** (requires 2FA) |

---

## 2) Run it
- Manual: **Actions → "Send Public Sector Briefing" → Run workflow**
- Scheduled: daily cron in `.github/workflows/daily.yml`

Cron is UTC (`30 6 * * *` = 07:30 Berlin winter / 08:30 Berlin summer). Adjust if you want a
fixed Berlin send time year-round.

### Preventing schedule auto-disable (important)
GitHub automatically disables scheduled workflows after **60 days of repo inactivity**
(no commits, issues, or PRs). For a bot repo where you never push code, this will happen.
The included `keepalive.yml` workflow commits a tiny timestamp file on the 1st of each month
to reset the inactivity clock. No action needed — it runs automatically once you push this repo.

If both workflows somehow get disabled simultaneously, go to **Actions → Keepalive → Run workflow**
to manually re-enable, then both will resume on their normal schedules.

### Recommended repository settings (GitHub UI)

This project is automation-only and does not require GitHub Pages.

- Go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Build and deployment → Source = Deploy from a branch → None** (or equivalent disabled state).
- If you intentionally use Pages in your fork, keep a valid branch/folder pair and avoid workflow triggers that can recursively re-trigger each other.
- In **Actions**, this repo should only need **Send Public Sector Briefing** for normal operation.

## 3) Customize territory + accounts
Edit: `src/config.json`

- `prepared_for`: your name
- `territory`: list of regions / orgs
- `briefing_mode`: `compact` (default) for tight, signal-first daily updates, or `standard` when you want more narrative context
- `lookback_hours`: recency window used in prompt instructions (default `72`)
- `accounts`: target accounts with seed “active projects to watch”
- `themes`: your 3–5 strategic themes
- `regulatory_items`: optional list of key regs/dates to always track
- `email.subject_prefix`: subject prefix for both briefing and operational fallback emails
- `sources`: public RSS/pages/procurement/trade sources collected before Gemini is called
- `ranking`: scoring weights for leadership, account, official-source, procurement, theme, and regulatory signals
- `email_v2`: newsroom digest settings, max stories, suppressed leads, and source-only fallback behavior

### Model + output control

Edit the `model` section in `src/config.json`:

- `preferred_models`: your preferred model IDs in execution order (recommended: only `gemini-2.5-flash`; retired 1.0/1.5 IDs are automatically ignored)
- `max_output_tokens`: generation token budget for the main pass
- `temperature`: model creativity level
- `brevity.target_words`: target range used in instructions
- `brevity.max_words`: hard target used in instructions for concise output
- `brevity.section_word_limits`: per-section word ceilings injected into the system instruction

If output still runs long, the script performs a compression pass that preserves section order and citations.

### Choosing a briefing mode

- `compact` (recommended for daily runs): Keeps the briefing short, allows 2 verified signals when fewer than 3 high-confidence developments exist, and limits subsection bullet density.
- `standard`: Better for stakeholder readouts where extra background is useful. It still remains evidence-based, but allows richer explanatory context.

---

## Notes on citations
The script requests grounded output and injects inline citations from Gemini's `groundingMetadata`.

**Known platform limitation:** `grounding_chunks` and `grounding_supports` are frequently
returned as empty by the Gemini API even when Google Search clearly ran (confirmed open bug,
early 2026). When this happens the email is still sent — citation injection is best-effort.
The Actions log will print a `WARN: grounding_metadata present but supports/chunks empty` line
with the `web_search_queries` that did run, so you can verify searches happened.

If citation count is below the configured threshold, a brief footer note is appended to the
email. Generation is **not** retried in this case (retrying cannot fix a server-side metadata
bug and would burn extra quota).

---


## Operational behavior (quota / billing)
If Gemini API quota or rate limits are exhausted, the workflow sends a short **quota alert email** instead of failing silently.

Operational sequence:
1. optional preflight check on the first configured model (`SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1` disables it)
2. source collector fetches configured public sources and writes candidate/rejected artifacts
3. Gemini receives only the structured candidate list and formats a newsroom-style digest
4. if Gemini quota/rate limits block generation, a source-only digest is sent from collected candidates
5. if collection produces no usable candidates, a quality alert is sent instead of fabricated content

GitHub Actions uploads quiet debug artifacts after each run:
- `candidate_signals.json`
- `rejected_candidates.json`
- `final_briefing.md`
- `quality_report.json`
- `source_only_fallback.md` when fallback mode is used

What to check if this happens repeatedly:
- Enable billing for your Google AI Studio project.
- Increase Gemini API limits (RPM/TPM).
- Reduce `model.max_output_tokens` in `src/config.json`.
- Optionally tighten `model.brevity.target_words` and `model.brevity.section_word_limits`.

## Scaling to “all public sector entities” in your states (recommended approach)

Trying to enumerate *every* entity name inside the LLM prompt is brittle and incomplete.
Instead, this template supports a **two-layer coverage model**:

### Layer A — Portal-first coverage (broad, entity-agnostic)
Each run prioritizes signals from sources that naturally cover **many public-sector entities at once**, e.g.:
- procurement / tender portals
- ministry & agency pressrooms
- budget / programme announcements

This gives you “whole-territory” coverage without maintaining a massive list.

### Layer B — Rotating entity spotlight (deep, specific)
A configurable number of entities are “spotlighted” each day (e.g., 25) so that over a week you cycle through the universe.
You can also set an “always-on” list (state CIO office, central IT provider, key ministries, etc.).

### Where to configure it
Edit `src/config.json`:
- `entity_coverage.mode`
- `entity_coverage.spotlight_entities_per_day`
- `entity_coverage.always_include`
- `entity_coverage.entity_universe_path`

And edit the universe itself:
- `src/entity_universe.json`

Tip: Start with top-level entities (state ministries, central IT providers, key agencies) and add subordinate bodies + major Kommunen over time.
