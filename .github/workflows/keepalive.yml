name: Keepalive

# GitHub automatically disables scheduled workflows after 60 days of repository
# inactivity (no commits, issues, or pull requests). This workflow commits a small
# marker file once a month to reset the inactivity clock and keep daily.yml running.
#
# If BOTH this workflow AND daily.yml are disabled (requires >60 days of zero
# activity of any kind), you must manually re-enable them in GitHub → Actions.
